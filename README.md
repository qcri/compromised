# Compromised vs. Attack Domains

This is the code repository for the USENIX Security 2021 paper "Compromised or Attacker-Owned: A Large Scale Classification and Study of Hosting Domains of Malicious URLs". 

The key problem we solve in this work is that given a malicious URL:
* Can we identify if it is hosted on a public or private apex?
* Can we identify if it is a compromised website or an attacker owned website?

The repository contains two key classifiers we build.
* Public-Private Classifier
* Compromised-Attacker Owned Classifier
